[**Aphrodite**](aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both [**mortals**](Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals") and gods at the goddessâ€™ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, [**Aphrodite**](aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (_aphros_) [**Uranus**](Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus")' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), she had affairs with all [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") except [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), most famously with [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares"), the god of war. She also had famous romances with two [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals"), [**Anchises**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Anchises/anchises.html "Anchises") and [**Adonis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adonis/adonis.html "Adonis").
