[**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") is the Olympian god of the [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun") and light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of _kalokagathia_, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") himself, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") mythology.

## **Apollo’s Role**

### **Name**

The origin of the name [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") is still not properly understood. Many Greeks seem to have supposed that it stands for “destroyer,” but this was only one of the many suggestions (“redemptory,” “purifier,” “assembler,” “stony”). Modern scholars disagree with most of them, with the majority linking [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s name to the Greek word _apella_ which means “a sheepfold,” and which may suggest that [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was originally merely a protector of the flocks and herds.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

However, in time, he evolved to become a multifaceted god adored all over Greece as the perfectly developed classical male nude, the _kouros_. Beardless and athletically built, he is often depicted with a laurel crown on his head and either a bow and arrow or a lyre and plectrum in his hands. The sacrificial tripod – representing his prophetic powers – was another common attribute of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), just as few animals linked with the god in various [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths"): wolf, dolphin, [**python**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Python/python.html "Python"), mouse, deer, swan.

### **Epithets**

[**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was in charge of so many things that, naturally, even his more famous epithets are numerous. As a [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun") god, he was called “Phoebus,” or “bright.” As a prophet, the Greeks called him “Loxias,” or “The One Who Speaks Crookedly.” As the god of music, he was known as the “Leader of the Muses.” Finally, the [**places**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/places.html "Places") of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s birth and worship adorned him with three other appellations: “Delian,” “Delphic,” and “Pythian.”

## **Apollo’s Birth and Sanctuaries · The Slaying of Python**

[**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") is the son of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"). As one of the numerous [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’s lovers, his mother incurred the wrath of [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), who sent the dragon [**Python**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Python/python.html "Python") to pursue [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") throughout all lands and forbade her to give birth anywhere on solid earth. Nobody would accept the pregnant Titaness, except for the island of Delos, where [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") first delivered [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") while balancing her body on an olive branch. Afterward, [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") helped her mother deliver [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") as well.

Fed exclusively with [**nectar**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/Nectar/nectar.html "Nectar") and [**ambrosia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/Ambrosia/ambrosia.html "Ambrosia"), in merely four days [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") grew strong and hungry for revenge. So, he went straight away to Parnassus where [**Python**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Python/python.html "Python") lived, and wounded the monster with his arrows. [**Python**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Python/python.html "Python") managed to escape and shelter itself at [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea")’s ancient sanctuary in [**Delphi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Delphi/delphi.html "Delphi"). [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was so enraged that he dared to violate the sanctity of the site by staining it with [**Python**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Python/python.html "Python")’s blood. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") ordered [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") to cleanse himself, after which he returned to [**Delphi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Delphi/delphi.html "Delphi") and claimed the shrine to his name.

After these events, Delos and [**Delphi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Delphi/delphi.html "Delphi") became sacred sites for the worship of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"), [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis"), and, especially, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"). The high priestess Pythia presided over the Temple of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") at [**Delphi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Delphi/delphi.html "Delphi"), serving as its enigmatic oracle.

## **Apollo and Music**

The day he was born, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") invented the lyre and stole [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s cattle. So as to appease his older brother after he found out what happened, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") offered [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") his new invention. Ever since then, the lyre became one of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s most famous attributes, and he its most celebrated master.

### **Apollo and Marsyas**

However, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s virtuosity would be challenged on at least three different occasions. The first one to dare do such a thing was the least fortunate one, the satyr [**Marsyas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Marsyas/marsyas.html "Marsyas"). He wasn’t bad at all playing the aulos (the double flute), even equaling [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s skill. However, he ultimately lost the contest, since, unlike [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), he couldn’t sing while playing. As punishment, [**Marsyas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Marsyas/marsyas.html "Marsyas") was hanged inside a cave and was subsequently flayed alive.

### **Apollo and Pan**

Fortunately for him, [**Pan**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Pan/pan.html "Pan") survived unscathed after challenging [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and almost unanimously losing the contest. [**Midas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/King_Midas/king_midas.html "King Midas"), however – the only judge who deemed that [**Pan**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Pan/pan.html "Pan") was the better player – got what he deserved: asses’ ears, since he obviously lacked human ears for music in the first place.

### **Apollo and Cinyras**

[**Cinyras**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cinyras/cinyras.html "Cinyras"), the King of Cyprus and a great flute player, didn’t learn anything from these two episodes. After losing his contest against [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), he was either killed by the god or committed suicide.

## **Apollo’s Ill-Fated Love Affairs**

[**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was loved by both gods and humans, women and men; and, more often than not, he loved them back as well. However, as it often happens, the most famous of his love affairs are the ones which didn’t end well.

### **Apollo and Coronis**

On two occasions, a mortal got the better of the god. Coronis was already pregnant with [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s son [**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius"), when she fell in love with Ischys. A white crow informed [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") of this affair which enraged [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") so much that he ordered [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") to kill Coronis and burned the feathers of the crow. Crows are black ever since.

### **Apollo and Marpessa**

After a while, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") fell in love with Marpessa. Her lover [**Idas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Idas/idas.html "Idas") had already went through hell to get her, even risking his own life while abducting her. But, he didn’t back down even in front of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), raising his bow and threatening him with an attack. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") stopped this fight and gave Marpessa the chance to choose. She chose [**Idas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Idas/idas.html "Idas") – since she feared that [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") would stop loving her after she grows old.

### **Apollo and Cassandra**

In an attempt to seduce her, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") gifted [**Cassandra**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cassandra/cassandra.html "Cassandra"), the Trojan princess, the gift of prophecy. However, afterward she backed out of the deal. Now, being a god, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") wasn’t allowed to recall his gift. But, he thought of a cunning idea to spoil it: he took away [**Cassandra**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cassandra/cassandra.html "Cassandra")’s powers of persuasion. Ever since, nobody believes her – even though her prophecies are always right.

### **Apollo and Daphne**

[**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s most famous love interest was [**Daphne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Daphne/daphne.html "Daphne"), a nymph who had once vowed to [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") to remain eternally innocent. [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), however, fell for her and persistently stalked her, until one day [**Daphne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Daphne/daphne.html "Daphne") couldn’t take it no more. She asked from her father, the river god [**Peneus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Peneus/peneus.html "Peneus"), to be transformed into something else. And just as [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was about to embrace her, she was – into a laurel tree. The god swore to love her forever and, ever since, he wears a laurel wreath as a token of his unhappy love.

### **Apollo and Cyparissus**

Both of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s most beloved male lovers were transformed into plants as well. After Cyparissus accidentally killed his pet-deer – which was gifted to him by [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") – he asked his divine lover to let him be sorrowful forever. So, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") unwillingly transformed Cyparissus into a cypress tree.

### **Apollo and Hyacinthus**

The story of [**Hyacinthus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hyacinthus/hyacinthus.html "Hyacinthus") is even sadder. He was a favorite of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and he dearly loved the god back. This made Zephyrus, the West Wind – a [**Hyacinthus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hyacinthus/hyacinthus.html "Hyacinthus")’ admirer himself – so jealous that, when the pair was practicing in the fields, he made [**Hyacinthus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hyacinthus/hyacinthus.html "Hyacinthus")’ discus swerve back and mortally wound him on the head. However, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") didn’t allow [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") to take all of [**Hyacinthus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hyacinthus/hyacinthus.html "Hyacinthus") to his realm: out of his spilled blood, the god created a flower which bears his lover’s name to this day.

## **Sources**

[**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") appears throughout most of the Greek literature. Three of the “Homeric Hymns” are dedicated to him: the [21st](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D21) and the [25th](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D25) are short ones, but the [3rd](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH%203) is fairly long and beautiful. In Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” you can find poetic accounts of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s love affairs with [Daphne](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D452), [Coronis](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D531), and [Hyacinthus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D143), as well as one of his [musical contest with Pan](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D146).
