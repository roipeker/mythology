[**Asteria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Asteria/asteria.html "Asteria") was a name given to a number of different beings in Greek mythology. As a deity, however, the name refers to a Titan goddess, daughter of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Coeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Coeus/coeus.html "Coeus") and [**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe") and sister of [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"). She was married to the Titan [**Perses**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Perses/perses.html "Perses"), and had a daughter, [**Hecate**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hecate/hecate.html "Hecate"). [**Asteria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Asteria/asteria.html "Asteria") was the goddess of nocturnal oracles and shooting stars. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") pursued her, but [**Asteria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Asteria/asteria.html "Asteria") instead turned into a quail and fell into the Aegean to escape. As a result, she transformed into Ortygia, the quail island, which was later linked to the island of Delos.
