[**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon"), and chastity; in time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. No more than few days old, she helped her mother [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") give birth to her twin brother [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"). [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") was very protective of her and her priestesses’ innocence. Consequently, she wasn’t very nice when some of them weren’t so careful.

## **Artemis’ Role**

### **Name**

Even though Plato says that the name “[**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis")” is related to her virginity and the Ancient Greek word for “unharmed” or “pure,” we now know that its origin is undoubtedly different and possibly even Persian. However, scholars can’t agree over its original meaning.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

Sculptors, poets, and painters, however, had no such problems. [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") is almost universally depicted as a young, beautiful and vigorous huntress carrying a quiver with arrows and holding a bow, typically wearing a short knee-high tunic and often accompanied by some animal (stag, doe, or hunting dogs). As a [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon") goddess, she is sometimes represented wearing a long robe and a crescent [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon") crown.

### **Epithets**

Homer calls [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") either “The Mistress of Animals” or “She of the Wild.” As a huntress, she is also often referred to as “arrow-pouring” or “deer-shooting.” Just like her brother, she may be occasionally called “bright” or, even more, illustrative of her function as a [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon") goddess, “torch-bringer.”

## **Artemis’ Family and Birth**

### **The Trials of Leto · The Birth of Artemis and Apollo**

[**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") is the daughter of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"), herself a daughter of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Coeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Coeus/coeus.html "Coeus") and [**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe"). Angered by her husband’s infidelity, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") hunted [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") over the whole planet and forbade her to give birth anywhere on solid earth. However, [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") got to the island of Delos and gave birth to [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") while balancing herself on an olive branch.  
When [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") heard this, she prohibited her daughter [**Eileithyia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eileithyia/eileithyia.html "Eileithyia"), the goddess of childbirth, of further helping [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"). This postponed the birth of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") for nine days. And who knows how much more time it would have passed if the baby [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") hadn’t miraculously learned the art of midwifery and helped [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") finally deliver her brother.

### **Protecting Leto · Niobe and Tityus**

[**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") and [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") were very protective of their mother. When [**Niobe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Niobe/niobe.html "Niobe") – a mother of six boys and as many girls – boasted that while [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") gave birth to two gods, she delivered a whole Olympus, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") killed all her children. [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") took care of the male offspring and [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") of [**Niobe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Niobe/niobe.html "Niobe")’s daughters. On another occasion, Tityus tried to rape [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"). Naturally, he was killed by [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s and [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis")’s arrows.

## **Artemis, the Vengeful Virgin Goddess**

When [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") was still a little maid, she asked from her father [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") to keep her maidenhood forever. So – just like [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") and [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") – she remained chaste for eternity. And she guarded this vow even more vigorously than them.

### **Artemis and Actaeon · Artemis and Siproites**

For example, when the hunter [**Actaeon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Actaeon/actaeon.html "Actaeon") saw her bathing naked, she transformed him into a stag and set his hounds against him. Needless to add, [**Actaeon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Actaeon/actaeon.html "Actaeon") was ripped apart to pieces. The less famous Siproites was just a boy when he had [**Actaeon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Actaeon/actaeon.html "Actaeon")’s misfortune of accidentally seeing the goddess unclothed. So, he was punished less severely: [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") transformed him into a girl.

### **Artemis and Orion**

Others tried to rape [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis"); none of them lived to tell. The most famous story involves [**Orion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Orion/orion.html "Orion"), a long-time hunting companion of hers. In fact, he may as well have been [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis")’ only love interest. However, when he tried taking off [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis")’ robe, the goddess killed him. Others say that [**Orion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Orion/orion.html "Orion") was actually killed by a scorpion sent by [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") or an [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s arrow; the gods merely tried to keep [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis")’ virginity intact the only time she couldn’t.

## **Artemis, the Defender of Purity**

[**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") didn’t only take care of her own purity; she also defended the innocence of her worshippers. And was merciless if any one of her priestesses ever lost it.

[**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") **and** [**Callisto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Callisto/callisto.html "Callisto")

For example, after her hunting attendant [**Callisto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Callisto/callisto.html "Callisto") gave birth to [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’s son Arcas, [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") contrived with [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") to turn her into a bear. The plan was to have Arcas kill her/ However, just as that was about to happen, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") placed both of them into the heavens as the [**constellations**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Constellations/constellations.html "Constellations") Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

### **Artemis and Hippolytus**

Just as she punished the transgressors of the sacred vow, [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") rewarded those who kept it. So as to devote himself to a chaste life, [**Hippolytus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolytus/hippolytus.html "Hippolytus") scorned [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") after which the goddess of love made his stepmother fall in love with him. This set a chain of events which led to [**Hippolytus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolytus/hippolytus.html "Hippolytus")’ death. However, [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") called upon [**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius") and resurrected [**Hippolytus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolytus/hippolytus.html "Hippolytus") as a new man, who subsequently ruled in Italy under the name of Virbius.

### **Artemis and Iphigenia**

In the case of [**Iphigenia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Iphigenia/iphigenia.html "Iphigenia"), [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") substituted the girl with a deer just as [**Iphigenia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Iphigenia/iphigenia.html "Iphigenia") was about to be sacrificed by her father, [**Agamemnon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Agamemnon/agamemnon.html "Agamemnon"). Afterward, she took [**Iphigenia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Iphigenia/iphigenia.html "Iphigenia") with her in [**Tauris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Tauris/tauris.html "Tauris") and made her a priestess of her cult.

“[The Homeric Hymn to Artemis](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH%209)” may be short and merely descriptive, but [Callimachus’ 3rd Hymn](https://www.archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/60/mode/2up) dedicated to [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") is lengthy and rather charming.
