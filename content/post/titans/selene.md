[**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion") and [**Theia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea"). She had two siblings, [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") and [**Eos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eos/eos.html "Eos"). She was the goddess of the [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon"), which she drove every night across the skies. [**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") was linked to [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") as well as [**Hecate**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hecate/hecate.html "Hecate"); all three were considered lunar goddesses.

She had an affair with a mortal named [**Endymion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Endymion/endymion.html "Endymion"), whom [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") had granted the choice of when he would die; [**Endymion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Endymion/endymion.html "Endymion") chose to fall into an eternal sleep to remain ageless and deathless. [**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") drove the silver [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon") chariot which was carried by two snow-white horses, as opposed to the golden [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun") chariot which was carried by four.

According to other sources, [**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") was one of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")' lovers and they had a number of children; Pandia, she who is all-bright; Ersa, the dew; [**Nemea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Nemea/nemea.html "Nemea"), the nymph of the eponymous place; and [**Dionysus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Dionysus/dionysus.html "Dionysus"), although this may be a confusion due to the name similarity between [**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") and [**Semele**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Semele/semele.html "Semele").
