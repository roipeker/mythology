[**Styx**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Styx/styx.html "Styx") was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") and [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys"), thus being one of the Oceanid sisters. She was the goddess of the River [**Styx**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Styx/styx.html "Styx"), and wife to the Titan [**Pallas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Pallas/pallas.html "Pallas"), with whom she had four children; [**Zelus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Zelus/zelus.html "Zelus"), [**Nike**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Nike/nike.html "Nike"), [**Kratos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Kratos/kratos.html "Kratos"), and [**Bia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Bia/bia.html "Bia"). [**Styx**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Styx/styx.html "Styx") fought on the side of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") during the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"), the great war between the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") and the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians"), the latter emerging victorious. To honour her, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") gave her name to the binding oath that was taken by the gods.

The River [**Styx**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Styx/styx.html "Styx") was the boundary between the realm of Earth and the Underworld. In its waters, the great [**hero**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hero/hero.html "Hero") [**Achilles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Achilles/achilles.html "Achilles") was submerged when he was an infant by his mother [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis"), thus making him invincible; however, as she held him by his heel, that was the only spot on his body that was vulnerable. This is how the phrase [**Achilles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Achilles/achilles.html "Achilles")' heel was created to signify a vulnerable spot.
