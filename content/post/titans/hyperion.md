[**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), son of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"). He represented light, wisdom and watchfulness. He was the father of the [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun"), the [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon"), and the dawn. In some early texts, the [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun") is mentioned as [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion"); however, in later texts, including Homer's and Hesiod's writings, [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion") and [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") are two different deities, the latter being a physical representation of the [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun"). [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion") is not mentioned in the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"), the War that resulted in the overthrow of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") and the start of the era of the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians").

[**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion") was married to his sister, [**Theia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea"), and they had three children, [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") (the [**sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun")), [**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") (the [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon")) and [**Eos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eos/eos.html "Eos") (the dawn). He was considered one of the four pillars that hold the heavens and the earth apart, and since his daughter was dawn, he was probably the pillar of the east. The other three pillars were his brothers [**Coeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Coeus/coeus.html "Coeus") (pillar of the north), [**Crius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html "Crius") (pillar of the south), and [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus") (pillar of the west). These four [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") were the ones that held their father [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") in place, while [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") castrated him with a sickle.
