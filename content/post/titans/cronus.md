![Cronus](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/cronus_15.jpg)

[**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") was the youngest son of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"), the leader of the first generation of [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), and, for a brief period, the ruler of all gods and men. He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as tyrannical as him, imprisoning both the [**Cyclops**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Cyclopes/cyclopes.html "Cyclopes") and the [**Hecatoncheires**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Hecatoncheires/hecatoncheires.html "Hecatoncheires"), and swallowing all of his children, save the last son; eventually, this child – [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") – would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in [**Tartarus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tartarus/tartarus.html "Tartarus").

## **Family and Children**

[**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") was the son of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"), the youngest one of the original Twelve [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"). This makes him the brother of five male siblings ([**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus"), [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion"), [**Coeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Coeus/coeus.html "Coeus"), [**Crius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html "Crius"), and [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus")) and six Titanides ([**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne"), [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys"), [**Theia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea"), [**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe"), [**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis"), and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea")). [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") eventually married his sister [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea"), with whom he fathered six children: [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia"), [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"), [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"), and [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus").

According to an isolated tale, [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") was also the father of the [**centaur**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Centaur/centaur.html "Centaur") [**Chiron**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Chiron/chiron.html "Chiron"), whom he begot after transforming himself into a mare to mislead the jealous [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") and secretly mating with Philyra, the daughter of [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus").

## **Portrayal**

Because his name was often confused with the Greek word for time, [**_Chronos_**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Primordial/Chronos/chronos.html "Chronos"), [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") was often depicted as Old Father Time, with whom, conveniently, he did share few characteristics: mercilessness, a beard, and a scythe. In fact, in many cases, the two are visually indistinguishable.

## **The Stages of Creation**

[**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") played a crucial part in [**the creation**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html "The Creation") of the known universe – first as a rebel against [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus"), then as the tyrant against whom [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") led his rebellion.

### **I The Castration of Uranus**

The story of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") begins with the irrational hate-driven decision of his father [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") (the Sky) to not allow his children (the [**Cyclopes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Cyclopes/cyclopes.html "Cyclopes"), the [**Hecatoncheires**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Hecatoncheires/hecatoncheires.html "Hecatoncheires"), and the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans")) to leave their mother’s womb, i.e., the Earth. Grief-stricken and straitened, [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") devised a crafty little plan, fashioned an adamantine sickle (_harpe_) and appealed to her offspring for help. “My children,” she said, “if you obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father.” [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") was the only one not seized by fear.

So, [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") gave [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") the sickle and hid him strategically in her womb. The very next night, when the love-longing [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") came to lie with [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"), [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") stretched forth his hand and castrated him. Afterward, he released his brothers and his sisters and, buoyant and prideful, he proclaimed himself the king of all gods and men.

### **II Cronus’ Rule: The Golden Age**

After seizing power, [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") married his sister [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") and, for a while, everything seemed all but perfect. Finally freed from her burdens, [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") was once again blissful and more than generous, producing crops for all human beings of her own accord. Untroubled by toils and hard work, the humans lived carefree and healthy lives, which ended peacefully and only when they were very old. Some say that even the gods themselves walked among the humans during the reign of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus"). Undoubtedly, this was the Golden Age, the most beautiful of the fabled five [**ages of man**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Ages_of_Man/ages_of_man.html "Ages of Man").

However, at some point, [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") violently and dramatically changed his ways. Fearing rebellion, he imprisoned both the [**Cyclopes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Cyclopes/cyclopes.html "Cyclopes") and the [**Hecatoncheires**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Hecatoncheires/hecatoncheires.html "Hecatoncheires") in [**Tartarus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tartarus/tartarus.html "Tartarus") and set the dragoness [**Campe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Campe/campe.html "Campe") to guard them. Alarmed by a prophecy saying that he would be overthrown by one of his children, he started swallowing them all, one by one. Seeing that her husband has, in essence, transformed into [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus"), after being impregnated with her sixth child, [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") turned to [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") for help.

### **III Zeus’ Rebellion: The Titanomachy**

[**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") counseled her daughter to go to [**Crete**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Crete/crete.html "Crete"), where eventually the Titaness gave birth to a mighty son, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"). Prompted by further advice, [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") left her child there and handed [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes in place of the supposed baby. [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") swallowed the stone, unsuspecting of any foul play, and unaware that nymphs are meanwhile raising his eventual overthrower in [**Crete**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Crete/crete.html "Crete").

When the time came, disguised as [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus")’ cupbearer, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") managed to slip his father a vomit-inducing drink (prepared by [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis")) in place of his favorite wine. This led to [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") disgorging all of his children, who subsequently teamed up with the [**Cyclopes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Cyclopes/cyclopes.html "Cyclopes") and the [**Hecatoncheires**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Hecatoncheires/hecatoncheires.html "Hecatoncheires") and ousted him from power after a bloody, decade-long war remembered forevermore as the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy").

### **IV Cronus’ Ultimate Destiny**

Deposed from the throne, [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") either escaped to Latium (modern Lazio) or was imprisoned in [**Tartarus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tartarus/tartarus.html "Tartarus") with the rest of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"). Either way, he seems to have reverted to his good old ways, since, in time, he was promoted to be the ruler of the Islands of the Blessed, a heaven-like abode, where the souls of only the greatest [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes") lived after their earthly deaths.

## **Saturnalia**

Unlike the Ancient Greeks, the Romans didn’t consider [**Saturn**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Saturn/saturn.html "Saturn") (for that is how they called [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus")) all that bad. Believing that once he escaped to Latium (the region of Italy that includes Rome), he instituted the Golden Age once again (this time solely in Rome), they celebrated him every December during a famous six-day festival called the Saturnalia, probably Rome’s most important holiday and one which has undoubtedly influenced the way people celebrate Christmas today.
