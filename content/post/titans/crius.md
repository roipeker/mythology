[**Crius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html "Crius") was considered one of the four pillars that hold the heavens and the earth apart. He represented the pillar of the south, while the other three pillars were personified by his brothers [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus"), [**Coeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Coeus/coeus.html "Coeus") and [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion"). The four brothers had an important role during the dethroning of their father, [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus"); as they were in the four corners of the earth, they held [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") in place, while their brother [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") castrated him with a sickle that their mother had given them.

In the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"), the war between the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") and the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians"), [**Crius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html "Crius") participated siding with the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), but did not have a specific role. When the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") were defeated, [**Crius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html "Crius") along with the rest of his siblings was thrown into [**Tartarus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tartarus/tartarus.html "Tartarus"), the lower level of the Underworld.
