[**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") was an ancient Greek god. According to one version, he was born by the union of the primal gods [**Chaos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Chaos/chaos.html "Chaos") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"), sanctified by god [**Eros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eros/eros.html "Eros"). Another version has it that he was one of the twelve [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), thus a son of [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") and [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus").

[**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") was married to his sister, [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys"), with whom he had numerous children, called Oceanids. These were the lesser gods and goddesses of the rivers, the sea, and the springs. In fact, [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") and [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys") were so fertile that the overproduction of the aqueous [**elements**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/elements.html "Elements") of nature would cause floods; so, they divorced to stop this from happening. The couple was not involved in the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy") against [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), so the latter let them continue their reign in their watery kingdom.

In ancient Greek art, [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") was depicted having bull horns and the tail of a serpentine fish instead of legs. He was later considered as a simple sea god or the personification of the sea.
