![Atlas](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/atlas_29.jpg)

[**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") was one of the most famous [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), the son of [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus") and the Oceanid Asia (or, possibly, [**Clymene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Clymene/clymene.html "Clymene")). He was the leader of the Titan rebellion against [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), and he got a fitting punishment after the end of the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"): he was condemned to eternally hold up the sky. Only once, and for a very brief period, he was bereaved of this burden by [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles"). [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus"), probably using [**Medusa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html "Medusa")’s head, turned him into the stony [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") Mountains.

## **Name and Portrayal**

[**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas")’ name is of unsure – probably pre-Greek – origin, but the Ancient Greeks and Romans seem to have thought it had been derived from a similar-sounding Greek root with the meaning of “very enduring.”

This fully coincides with [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas")’ portrayal as an enormous, bearded man, always slightly bent and in pain under the weight of the heavens, usually represented as a globe sketched with the most famous [**constellations**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Constellations/constellations.html "Constellations").

## **Family**

According to Hesiod, [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") was the son of the Titan [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus") and the Oceanid [**Clymene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Clymene/clymene.html "Clymene"). However, some – disagreeing with him – say that his mother was another sea nymph named Asia. Either way, he had three brothers ([**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus"), [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus"), and [**Menoetius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Menoetius/menoetius.html "Menoetius")) and possibly as many wives.

By Pleione, he had eight daughters: the goddess-nymph [**Calypso**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Calypso/calypso.html "Calypso") and the seven Pleiades ([**Alcyone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Alcyone/alcyone.html "Alcyone"), Asterope, [**Electra**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Electra/electra.html "Electra"), Caleano, Taygete, Merope and [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes")’ mother, Maia). Another Oceanid, [**Aethra**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Aethra/aethra.html "Aethra"), bore him few more daughters, the [**Hyades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Hyades/hyades.html "Hyades"), and his only son, [**Hyas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Hyas/hyas.html "Hyas"). Finally, according to some, the [**Hesperides**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Hesperides/hesperides.html "Hesperides") were also [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas")’ daughters, out of his marriage with Hesperis.

## **The Titanomachy and Atlas’ Punishment**

[**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus")’ sons took the opposing sides during the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"): while [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") and [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") decided to help [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") and his brother [**Menoetius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Menoetius/menoetius.html "Menoetius") sided with the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"). In time, [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") even managed to become the leader of the rebellion, but that didn’t end up too well for him in the long run, since it got him the most severe punishment after the defeat of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans").

Namely, [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") was condemned to hold up the heavens for all eternity, standing at the furthest west edges of the earth near the garden of his daughters, the [**Hesperides**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Hesperides/hesperides.html "Hesperides"). Some say that the sky was placed directly on his shoulders. Others, however, are more merciful, claiming that [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") actually holds the two pillars which keep the earth and the sky apart.

## **Meetings with Heroes**

Since, obviously, [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") wasn’t allowed to move one bit – and not many people knew where his dwelling place was – the only [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths") he’s in include two of Greek’s greatest [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes") reaching him at the end of the earth.

### **Heracles**

The first of them was [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles"), who, after having two of his original ten labors invalidated, was tasked with bringing [**Eurystheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Eurystheus/eurystheus.html "Eurystheus") few of the Hesperidean golden apples. [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles") smartly offered [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") to switch roles with him so that the Titan could fetch the apples from his daughters himself, causing no fuss or drawing unnecessary attention from [**Ladon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Ladon/ladon.html "Ladon"), the dragon-guardian of the apples.

[**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") did just that but had a plan of his own – to deliver the apples himself to [**Eurystheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Eurystheus/eurystheus.html "Eurystheus") and then, of course, forget all about [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles") and his old job. [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles"), however, outsmarted the gullible Titan, agreeing to the plan but asking him to hold for him the sky first so that he could adjust himself in a more comfortable position. Instead, [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles") just seized the golden apples and never looked back.

### **Perseus**

The second – and last – [**hero**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hero/hero.html "Hero") to visit [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") was [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus"). Passing by the Titan, [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus") asked him for hospitality, but [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas"), fearing some humiliating trick yet again, turned him down. So, [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus") showed him the head of [**Medusa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html "Medusa") and [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") was turned into stone, i.e., the mountain range in North Africa which still bears his name.
