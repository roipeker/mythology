[**Thea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), daughter of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"). The alternative spelling of her name, [**Theia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea"), means divine; goddess; while her other name, [**Euryphaessa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea"), is a combination of the Greek words "eury", meaning wide, and "phaos", meaning bright. Hence, she was the goddess of light and was thought to be of considerable beauty. She was also the deity that endowed gold, silver and gems with their radiance.

Based on a poem by Homer, [**Thea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html "Thea") was married to her brother [**Hyperion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Hyperion/hyperion.html "Hyperion"), giving birth to [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") (the [**Sun**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Sun/sun.html "Sun")), [**Selene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Selene/selene.html "Selene") (the [**Moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon")), and [**Eos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eos/eos.html "Eos") (the Dawn). She was an oracular goddess, as she was the prophetic deity of an oracular shrine in the region of Phtiotis in Thessaly.
