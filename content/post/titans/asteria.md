[**Asteria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Asteria/asteria.html "Asteria") was the goddess of nocturnal oracles and shooting stars. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") pursued her, but [**Asteria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Asteria/asteria.html "Asteria") instead turned into a quail and fell into the Aegean to escape. As a result, she transformed into Ortygia, the quail island, which was later linked to the island of Delos.
