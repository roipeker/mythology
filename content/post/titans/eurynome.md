[**Eurynome**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eurynome/eurynome.html "Eurynome") was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") and [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys"), hence an Oceanid. She was the third wife of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), with whom she had the three [**Charites**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/The_Graces/the_graces.html "The Graces"), goddesses of [**grace**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/The_Graces/the_graces.html "The Graces"). When [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") was thrown off [**Mount Olympus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Mount_Olympus/mount_olympus.html "Mount Olympus") by his mother [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") for being crippled, [**Eurynome**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eurynome/eurynome.html "Eurynome") and [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis") caught him and raised him. [**Eurynome**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eurynome/eurynome.html "Eurynome") may also have been a goddess of pasturelands.

She was also often linked to another [**Eurynome**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eurynome/eurynome.html "Eurynome"), who was an early Queen of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") alongside her husband, [**Ophion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Ophion/ophion.html "Ophion").
