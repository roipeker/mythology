[**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), daughter of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"), and goddess of memory. She was also occassionally referred to as Mneme; however, this was the name of another goddess. She was the oracular goddess of the underground oracle of Trophonios in the region of Boeotia.

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") slept with [**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne") for nine consecutive days, eventually leading to the birth of the nine Muses. In Hesiod's [**Theogony**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html "The Creation"), the kings and poets were inspired by [**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne") and the Muses, thus getting their extraordinary abilities in speech and using powerful words.

The name [**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne") was also used for a river in the Underworld, [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), which flowed parallel to the river of [**Lethe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Lethe/lethe.html "Lethe") (which means forgetfulness). Usually, the souls of the dead would drink water from [**Lethe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Lethe/lethe.html "Lethe"), so that they would forget their past lives when they would be reincarnated. However, the souls of the novices were told to drink water from [**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne"). This myth may have been part of a small mystic religion or be tied to Orphic poetry.
