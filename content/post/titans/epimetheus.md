![Epimetheus](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/epimetheus_28.jpg)

[**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), son of [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus") and [**Clymene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Clymene/clymene.html "Clymene"). He was the brother of [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus"), [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") and [**Menoetius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Menoetius/menoetius.html "Menoetius"). His name is derived from the Greek word meaning 'afterthought', which is the antonym of his brother's name, [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus"), meaning 'forethought'. In this context, [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") appeared as a foolish character, while [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") was the clever one.

[**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") and [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") were told to distribute characteristics to the newly created animals. [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") started giving a positive trait to every animal, but lacking foresight, he realised that he had distributed all traits without having any left to give to man. So, [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") gave mankind the civilizing arts and fire.

[**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") received [**Pandora**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pandora/pandora.html "Pandora") as a gift from the gods; a human created by the gods specifically to punish the humans. The marriage of [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus") and [**Pandora**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pandora/pandora.html "Pandora") is not explicit in any source, but only implied; from their union, [**Pyrrha**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pyrrha/pyrrha.html "Pyrrha"), their daughter, was born. [**Pandora**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pandora/pandora.html "Pandora") was given a jar which contained all evils of humanity; curious to see what was inside, she opened it and all evils were released into the world. Shocked, she closed it as soon as she could, but only Hope remained trapped inside.
