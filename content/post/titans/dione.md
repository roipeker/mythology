[**Dione**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Dione/dione.html "Dione") was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, most probably a daughter of [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") and [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys") and thus, an Oceanid. According to some sources, she was the first wife of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), with whom she had a daughter, the goddess [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"). She was an oracle and was worshipped alongside [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") at the earliest Oracle in Greece that was located at Dodona. She made an appearance in Homer's Iliad, when her daughter was wounded and she tried to heal her. The priestesses and prophetesses at her shrine in Dodona were called Peleiades or the Doves, which was the sacred bird of her daughter, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite").

There was also another [**Dione**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Dione/dione.html "Dione"), a nymph and the daughter of [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas"). She became the wife of king [**Tantalus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Tantalus/tantalus.html "Tantalus"), and they had two sons, [**Pelops**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pelops/pelops.html "Pelops") and [**Broteas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Broteas/broteas.html "Broteas"), and a daughter, [**Niobe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Niobe/niobe.html "Niobe").
