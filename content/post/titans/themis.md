[**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), daughter of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"). She was the human-like representation of the natural and moral order. The name derives from the Greek word meaning that which is current and contemporary. According to Hesiod, she was the second wife of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), a marriage that helped the supreme Olympian to stabilise his power over all gods and humans.

[**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis") also represents the law and undisputed order, the divine right. She was the goddess that created the divine laws that govern everything and are even above gods themselves. In general, [**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis") had three subsistences; goddess of natural order, which manifested through the Hores (the Hours), meaning the seasonal and never-ceasing rotation of time; goddess of moral order, manifested through Eunomia (fair order), Deke (trial) and Erene (peace), which were the utmost characteristics of the society, and through the Moires, which represented the destiny of every human being; and finally, goddess of prophecy, shown through the Nymphs, as well as the virgin [**Astraea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Astraea/astraea.html "Astraea").

Initially, [**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis") substituted her mother in the Oracle of [**Delphi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Delphi/delphi.html "Delphi"), having inherited the ability to foresee events from her; however, when [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was born, [**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis") cared so much for him that she eventually offered the Oracle to him.
