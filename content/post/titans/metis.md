[**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), a daughter of [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus") and [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys"); therefore, she was considered an Oceanid. She was the first wife of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), and became the goddess of wisdom, prudence and deep thought.

According to a prophecy, [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis") would bear two children, the first being [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), while the second one, a son, would be so powerful that would overthrow [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"). [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), afraid of this, tricked [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis") into turning herself into a fly, and swallowed her. However, [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis") was already pregnant to [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), and, inside [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")' stomach, she started creating a helmet for her daughter. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was in such pain that he asked [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") to hit his head with an axe; as soon as his head was opened, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") jumped out fully grown and clad in armour. It is often said that [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") had no mother and she was born out of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") alone; this doesn't necessarily conflict with this account, as the ancient Greeks believed that children were descendants of the fathers, while mothers did not contribute to [**the creation**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html "The Creation") of their children.
