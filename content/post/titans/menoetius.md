[**Menoetius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Menoetius/menoetius.html "Menoetius") was a Titan god, son of [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Iapetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Iapetus/iapetus.html "Iapetus") and [**Clymene**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Clymene/clymene.html "Clymene"), and brother of [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas"), [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") and [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus"). His name derives from the Ancient Greek words "menos" (might) and "oitos" (doom), meaning "doomed might".
