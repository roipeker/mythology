[**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), daughter of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"). She was married to her brother, [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus"), and gave birth to the river gods, who lived in the rivers that were then known to the Greeks, such as the Nile and [**Alpheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Alpheus/alpheus.html "Alpheus"); and to three thousand water goddesses, called Oceanids. Despite being the mother of so many deities in the Greek mythology, [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys") was not actively worshipped. During the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"), she raised [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") as her stepchild, brought to her by [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea").

According to one myth, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") did not like that [**Callisto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Callisto/callisto.html "Callisto") and Arcas were placed in the heavens by being turned into the [**constellations**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Constellations/constellations.html "Constellations") Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, so she asked [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys") to do something about it. To appease [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), [**Tethys**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Tethys/tethys.html "Tethys") denied the [**constellations**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Constellations/constellations.html "Constellations") from being able to touch the sea and fall below the horizon; instead, they were forever doomed to circle the sky.
