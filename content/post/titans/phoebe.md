[**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe") was one of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), daughter of [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"). She was married to her brother [**Coeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Coeus/coeus.html "Coeus"), with whom she had [**Asteria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Asteria/asteria.html "Asteria") (the starry one) and [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"). The [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis"), twin siblings, were the children of [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto"); thus, they were often referred to as Phoebus and [**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe") respectively, taking their alternative names from their grandmother. [**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe") was associated with the [**moon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Moon/moon.html "Moon") and the Oracle of [**Delphi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Delphi/delphi.html "Delphi"), and was considered to be the goddess of prophecy.

In the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"), the War between the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") and the Olympian gods which resulted in the defeat of the former, [**Phoebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Phoebe/phoebe.html "Phoebe") did not participate and therefore, she was spared imprisonment in [**Tartarus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tartarus/tartarus.html "Tartarus").
