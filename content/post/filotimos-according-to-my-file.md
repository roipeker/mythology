## φιλότιμο

**Philotimo** is considered to be the highest of all Greek virtues, the standards for family and social living; the core concept is that of respect and walking in right paths. In its simplest form, the term means "doing good", actions that ensure that one's behavior be exemplary and demonstrate one's personality and the manner in which one was raised. Philotimo to a Greek is essentially a way of life.

Children are said to display philotimo when they display unconditional love and respect towards their parents, grandparents and friends, even though small actions such as expressions of gratitude for small gifts or random acts of kindness. It extends to include appreciation and admiration for heritage and ancestors. The concept was used to embody the assistance rendered to Allied soldiers on Crete after the Axis invasion of the island; locals felt driven by philotimo to hide Australians and Britons despite the death penalty for sheltering soldiers.
