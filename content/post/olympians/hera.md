[**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") is the wife of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage, however, was an unhappy one, since [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") had numerous affairs. Jealous and vengeful, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") made sure to give each of his consorts some hard time.

## **Hera’s Role**

### **Name**

Based on the number of cults, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") was a very ancient goddess, possibly predating even [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"). In fact, it’s assumed that we don’t even know her original name. “[**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")” is actually a title, which is usually translated as “Lady” or “Mistress.” [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")’s [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") counterpart was Juno, the goddess who gave her name to the month of June, even today, the most popular time for weddings.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

[**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") was usually portrayed alongside [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), as a fully clothed matronly woman of solemn beauty, wearing a cylindrical crown called _polos_ or a wreath and a veil. Sometimes she carries a scepter capped with a pomegranate and a cuckoo – the former a symbol of fertility, the latter a token of the way she was wooed by [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"). She is also often accompanied by a peacock, one of her sacred animals.

### **Epithets**

Homer often refers to [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") as “cow-eyed” and “white-armed” – which are her most famous epithets. She is also sometimes called “a virgin,” since it was believed that every year she bathed in a spring to renew her virginity.

## **Family**

Being born after [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") and [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"), [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") is the youngest of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus")’ and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea")’s three daughters and their third child overall; [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"), and [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") – in that order – are her younger brothers. However, since just like each of her siblings but [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), she was swallowed by her father at birth and later disgorged to be born again, she is sometimes referred to as [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus")’ and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea")’s oldest daughter. Reasonably, since the Titan had to empty his stomach of his children in the order opposite of the one in which he [**ate**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Ate/ate.html "Ate") them.

## **The Archetypal Married Couple: Hera and Zeus**

As the guardian of marriage and the spouse of the King of Gods and Men, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") didn’t have much choice but to be a faithful wife. Even though she was beautiful, not many men – and not one god – dared to lay hands on her. [**Endymion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Endymion/endymion.html "Endymion") tried once, but [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") condemned him to eternal sleep. [**Ixion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Ixion/ixion.html "Ixion") fared even worse: [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") fooled him into making love with a cloud fashioned in [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")’s image, and then ordered [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") to bind him to a perpetually turning wheel of fire.

By most accounts, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") gave [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") four children: [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares"), the god of war, [**Eileithyia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eileithyia/eileithyia.html "Eileithyia"), the goddess of childbirth, [**Hebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hebe/hebe.html "Hebe"), the goddess of eternal youth, and [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), the god of fire.

## **Hera, a Vengeful Wife**

### **The Wooing of Hera**

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") tricked [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") into marriage. Knowing full well that the goddess loved animals, he transformed himself into a distressed cuckoo and reverted to his original form only when [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") took the poor creature to her breast to warm it. Ashamed for being taken advantage of, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") agreed to a marriage.

### **Hera Challenges Zeus**

However, it didn’t turn out to be a happy one. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was brutish and cruel to everybody. Incapable of bearing this, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") plotted a revenge plan with [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"), [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") and possibly few [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods"). She drugged [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), and they bound him on his bed, while stealing his thunderbolt. [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis"), however, summoned Briareus and he managed to quickly untie [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), who was, subsequently, merciless to the main schemer: he hung [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") from the sky with golden chains.

To grant herself a release, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") swore to never rebel again against her husband. So, she directed her anger toward [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’s lovers and their offspring, becoming a jealous and vindictive wife.

### **Hera and Semele**

For example, she tricked [**Semele**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Semele/semele.html "Semele") into forcing her lover – which she knew was [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") – to reveal himself before her in all his glory. Since humans can’t look upon at gods without incinerating, [**Semele**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Semele/semele.html "Semele") perished into thin air.

### **Hera and Callisto**

Later, she turned [**Callisto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Callisto/callisto.html "Callisto") into a bear, after the latter gave birth to [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ child Arcas. After some time, just as Arcas was about to unwittingly kill his mother, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") placed [**Callisto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Callisto/callisto.html "Callisto") and her son in the sky as the [**constellations**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Constellations/constellations.html "Constellations") Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Big and the Little Bear.

### **Hera and the Delaying of Births**

[**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") kept her daughter [**Eileithyia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eileithyia/eileithyia.html "Eileithyia") from attending the birth of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), postponing it by nine days and nights. More famously, she did the same with [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles"); in this case, the delay caused [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles") the throne of Argolid.

### **Hera and Io**

Arguably, [**Io**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Io/io.html "Io") was the one who endured the most. First [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") transformed her into a cow so that he can hide her from [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"). Then, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") sent [**Argus Panoptes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Argus_Panoptes/argus_panoptes.html "Argus Panoptes") to watch over her, and [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") – [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") to kill him. After that, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") transformed Argus’ ghost into a gadfly which bothered [**Io**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Io/io.html "Io") in her bovine form all the way to Egypt. Finally, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") impregnated her there with [**Epaphus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Epaphus/epaphus.html "Epaphus").

## **Hera, the Vain Goddess**

Just like most of the other Greek goddesses, when it came to her beauty, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") was easily offended.

Once, [**Orion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Orion/orion.html "Orion")’s wife Side (“pomegranate”) boasted that she was as beautiful as [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), so the goddess sent her to the Underworld. When [**Laomedon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Laomedon/laomedon.html "Laomedon")’s daughter [**Antigone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Antigone/antigone.html "Antigone") did the same, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") turned her into a stork. Finally, after [**Paris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Paris/paris.html "Paris") chose [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") instead of her, she became a sworn enemy of [**Troy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Troy/troy.html "Troy").
