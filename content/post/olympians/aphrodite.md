[**  
Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals") and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (_aphros_) [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus")' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), she had affairs with all [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") except [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), most famously with [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares"), the god of war. She also had famous romances with two [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals"), [**Anchises**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Anchises/anchises.html "Anchises") and [**Adonis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adonis/adonis.html "Adonis").

## **Aphrodite’s Role**

### **Name**

[**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite")’s name is usually linked to the Ancient Greek word for “sea-foam,” _aphros_, which fits nicely with the story of her birth. However, modern scholars think that both [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") and her name predate Ancient Greece and that the story actually came because of the goddess’ name.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism · Phryne**

If [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") represented the ideal of the perfect male body to the Greeks, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") was certainly his most appropriate female counterpart. Beautiful and enchanting, she was frequently depicted nude, as a symmetrically perfect maiden, infinitely desirable and as infinitely out of reach. She was sometimes represented alongside [**Eros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eros/eros.html "Eros") and with some of her major attributes and symbols: a magical girdle and a shell, a dove or a sparrow, roses, and myrtles.

Once, during an important religious festival, the hetaera Phryne decided to swim naked in the sea. The famous painter Apelles was so overwhelmed by the exquisite sight that he drew the most famous (now lost) painting of the Ancient World: “[**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") Rising from the Sea.” Many artists have tried recreating it during the centuries past. The sculptor Praxiteles had a bit more luck than Apelles: he also modeled his most celebrated sculpture of [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") after Phryne, but a copy of that sculpture has survived to this day. It is one of the first life-sized female nudes in history. Plato says that when [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") saw the sculpture, "Alas!" said she, "where did Praxiteles see me naked?"

### **Epithets**

Worshipped by basically everybody, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), “the One who rises from the sea” was appropriately called _Pandemos_, “of all the people.” However, she was also called _Ourania_ or “heavenly,” so some Greek moralists tried to make a distinction between these two Aphrodites, claiming that [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") Pandemos is the goddess of sexual desire and [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") Ourania, the one of “platonic love.” Now we know that this was the same goddess, called by numerous other contradictory epithets as well, which often describe the complex nature of love: “smile-loving,” “merciful,” and the “One who postpones old age,” but also “unholy,” “the dark one,” “the killer of men.”

## **Aphrodite’s Birth**

Homer and Hesiod tell two different stories about the origin of [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite").

According to the former, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") was the daughter of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and the Titaness Diona, thus making her a second-generation goddess, much like the most [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians").

However, Hesiod retells the much more famous myth. According to him, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") was born when [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus")’ genitals fell into the sea after he was castrated by his son [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus"). The goddess of love emerged from the waters on a scallop shell, fully-grown, nude, and more beautiful than anything anyone had ever seen before or since.

## **The Almighty Aphrodite: The Goddess Even Gods Can’t Resist**

### **Aphrodite Married to Hephaestus**

[**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") was so lovely that only the three virgin goddesses – [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis"), [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), and [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") – were immune to her charms and power. Unsurprisingly, the second she got on Olympus, she inadvertently wreaked havoc amongst the [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods"), each of whom instantly wanted to have her for himself. So as to prevent this, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") hurriedly married her to [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), the ugliest among the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians"). Of course, this merely alleviated the problem: [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") didn’t plan to remain faithful.

### **Aphrodite and Ares**

So, she started an affair with someone as destructive and as violent as herself: [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares"). [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios"), however, saw them and informed [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), after which the cuckolded god made sure to devise a fine bronze net, which ensnared the couple the next time they lay together in bed. To add insult to injury, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") called upon all the [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods") to laugh at the adulterers and freed them only after [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") agreed to pay for their release.

### **Aphrodite and Poseidon**

Poor [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus")! He couldn’t have known that when [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") saw [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") naked, he fell in love with her all over again. He must have found out later, since [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") gave [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") at least one daughter, [**Rhode**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Rhode/rhode.html "Rhode"). And she didn’t give up on [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") either! In fact, after the bronze net scandal, she bore the god of war as many as eight children: [**Deimos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Deimos/deimos.html "Deimos"), [**Phobos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Phobos/phobos.html "Phobos"), [**Harmonia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Harmonia/harmonia.html "Harmonia"), [**Adrestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adrestia/adrestia.html "Adrestia") and the four Erotes ([**Eros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eros/eros.html "Eros"), [**Anteros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Anteros/anteros.html "Anteros"), Pothos, and Himeros).

### **Aphrodite and Hermes**

[**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") didn’t have many consorts, but he did have [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") at least once, as the very name of their offspring, Hermaphrodites, suggests. And if we take into account that [**Priapus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Priapus/priapus.html "Priapus") is usually considered a son of [**Dionysus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Dionysus/dionysus.html "Dionysus") and [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), it seems that only [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") managed to never fall for the goddess of love. But the second one didn’t even live on Olympus, and the former may have been her father.

## **Aphrodite Among the Mortals**

When she wasn’t busy making other people fall in love, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") had some time to fall in love herself.

### **Adonis**

Once, she took a baby boy she had found beside a myrrh tree to the Underworld and asked [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") to take good care of him. However, when she went to visit him after many years, she instantly fell in love with the now unusually handsome mortal. So, he asked to have [**Adonis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adonis/adonis.html "Adonis") – for that was the boy’s name – back. [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") wouldn’t allow this. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") settled the quarrel by dividing [**Adonis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adonis/adonis.html "Adonis")’ time between the two goddesses. However, [**Adonis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adonis/adonis.html "Adonis") preferred [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") and, when the time came, he didn’t want to go back to the Underworld. [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") sent a wild boar to kill him, and [**Adonis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adonis/adonis.html "Adonis") bled to death in [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite")’s arms. The couple had two children: Beroe and Golgos.

### **Anchises**

Another time, [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") fell for a Trojan prince called [**Anchises**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Anchises/anchises.html "Anchises"). Pretending to be a princess herself, she seduced him and slept with him. Only afterward she revealed herself, promising him a noble son and warning him to keep the affair to himself. [**Anchises**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Anchises/anchises.html "Anchises") wasn’t able to, so he was struck by [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ thunderbolt which blinded him. And he wasn’t able to see his son, [**Aeneas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Aeneas/aeneas.html "Aeneas"), found the mighty [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") Empire.

### **Paris**

[**Paris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Paris/paris.html "Paris") was the third and final mortal who was blessed with seeing [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") naked. This happened when he was tasked with judging who of the three goddesses – [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), and [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") – was the fairest. [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") promised [**Paris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Paris/paris.html "Paris") the most beautiful girl in the world if he chose her, so, naturally, he did. [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") made sure that he gets [**Helen**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Helen/helen.html "Helen"), the Spartan queen, an event which triggered the bloody decade-long [**Trojan War**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Trojan_War/trojan_war.html "Trojan War").

## **Aphrodite, the Unforgiving: Hippolytus, Eos, Diomedes, Psyche**

Few dared to resist the power of [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), and she had mercy for none of them. [**Hippolytus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolytus/hippolytus.html "Hippolytus") preferred [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") to her and vowed to eternal innocence. [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") made his stepmother [**Phaedra**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Phaedra/phaedra.html "Phaedra") fall in love with him, which resulted in the death of both her and [**Hippolytus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolytus/hippolytus.html "Hippolytus").

After [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") found out that [**Eos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eos/eos.html "Eos") had slept with [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares"), she cursed her to be perpetually – and unhappily – in love. Diomedes wounded the goddess during the [**Trojan War**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Trojan_War/trojan_war.html "Trojan War"), and suddenly his wife Aegiale started sleeping around with his enemies.

[**Psyche**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Psyche/psyche.html "Psyche") would have gone through an even worse ordeal, but, fortunately for her, [**Eros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eros/eros.html "Eros") – [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite")’s avenger – shot himself instead of her and fell in love with [**Psyche**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Psyche/psyche.html "Psyche") instead.

Few poems are more beautiful than [Lucretius’ invocation of Aphrodite](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/785/785-h/785-h.htm#link2H_4_0001) at the beginning of “On the Nature of Things.” Compare this to the longest of the three Homeric Hymns dedicated to [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), [the 5th one](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH%205).
