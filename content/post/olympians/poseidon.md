### Greek God of the Sea

![Poseidon](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/poseidon_2.jpg)

[**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the Twelve [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians"), he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously with [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") and [**Odysseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Odysseus/odysseus.html "Odysseus").

## **Poseidon’s Role**

### **Name**

[**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon")’s name is very old, and its meaning is lost to us. Various authors have tried to translate it as either “husband of the earth” or “lord of the waters.” Plato says that it means “knower of many things,” but this is much less likely.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

[**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") is nowadays known exclusively as a sea god, but in ancient times, he may have been the god of the earth and fertility or even the supreme god of the sky. In fact, in portrayals, he looks very much like [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), a distinguished, bearded man with a dense curly hair and piercing eyes. Homer says that his shriek was as loud as one of ten thousand men combined.

Oftentimes, he is depicted riding a four-horse chariot and wielding a trident over the waves. The trident is his most recognizable emblem, though his son, [**Triton**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Triton/triton.html "Triton"), carries one as well. It is said that [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") struck a rock with his trident to create the very first horse, Skyphios. During the [**Gigantomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Gigantomachy/gigantomachy.html "Gigantomachy"), the god used the trident to break off a piece of the island Kos, under which he subsequently entombed the Giant [**Polybotes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Gigantes/Polybotes/polybotes.html "Polybotes"). This piece became today’s island Nisyros.

### **Epithets**

Since [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") had multiple powers, the Ancient Greeks invented various epithets to describe his manifestations and pray to him. To some, he was the “Savior of Sailors,” to others the “Averter of Earthquakes.” Yet a third group venerated him as “The Creator and Tamer of Horses” and to a fourth one he was “The Leader of Nymphs.”

## **Family**

[**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") was the second son of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") (after [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades")) and their penultimate child (before [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")). [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia"), [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"), and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") were his sisters.

Like all of his siblings aside from [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") was swallowed by [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") at birth and, thanks to [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), afterward disgorged unharmed.

However, some say that [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") managed to hide [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") from his father’s rage as well – either in a flock of lambs in [**Arcadia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Arcadia/arcadia.html "Arcadia") or in Rhodes to be raised by [**Oceanus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Oceanus/oceanus.html "Oceanus")’ daughter Capheira and the [**Telchines**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Telchines/telchines.html "Telchines").

## **Disputes with Other Gods and Men**

### **Poseidon Challenges Zeus**

[**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") had a very violent character, Impulsive and hot-blooded, he couldn’t put up with [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ arrogant behavior as a ruler. So, he teamed up with [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") and [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") to teach him a lesson. However, with the help of [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis") and Briareus, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") overpowered his challengers.

### **Poseidon, Laomedon, and the Trojans**

As punishment, he sent [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") and [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") to serve the Trojan king [**Laomedon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Laomedon/laomedon.html "Laomedon"), for whom they built the vast, beautiful walls surrounding [**Troy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Troy/troy.html "Troy"). However, when the time came, [**Laomedon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Laomedon/laomedon.html "Laomedon") refused to pay them. As a result, [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") – even against the advice of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") – fought on the Greek side during the [**Trojan war**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Trojan_War/trojan_war.html "Trojan War"), sending a sea monster named [**Cetus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Cetus/cetus.html "Cetus") to torment the Trojans.

### **Poseidon, the Greeks, and Odysseus**

Even so, the narcissist that he was, [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") destroyed the fortifications built by the Greeks, firmly believing that his walls are the only buildings of the type worthy to remain. And, mad at him for blinding his son [**Polyphemus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Polyphemus/polyphemus.html "Polyphemus"), he had a decade-long feud with one of the greatest Greek [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes"), [**Odysseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Odysseus/odysseus.html "Odysseus").

### **Poseidon and Athena**

The god of the sea was also greedy – especially when it came to earthly kingdoms. Once, he even wanted to obtain [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens") from [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), claiming that the city would have much more benefit from him than her. To prove this, he struck his trident into a rock, creating a seawater stream which welled up in the Temple of Erechtheion on the north side of the Acropolis. [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), in turn, planted an olive tree. [**Cecrops**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cecrops/cecrops.html "Cecrops"), the first king of [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"), decided that [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena")’s gift was more useful since it gave fruit, wood, and oil. [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") kept [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"), and ever since then, the olive branch is a universal symbol of peace.

## **Poseidon’s Women and Children**

Just like [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") had a weak spot for women. And, much like him, he was not exactly loved back by them. However, what he couldn’t acquire with romance and gentleness, he did with violence and craftiness.

### **Caeneus and Medusa**

For example, he took by force both Caeneus and [**Medusa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html "Medusa"), who was afterward transformed into a beast by [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") as a punishment for allowing this. After [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus") beheaded the pregnant monster, [**Medusa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html "Medusa") gave birth to [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon")’s children, [**Chrysaor**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Chrysaor/chrysaor.html "Chrysaor") and [**Pegasus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Pegasus/pegasus.html "Pegasus").

### **Demeter, Amymone, and Aethra**

To trick [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") who turned into a mare to reject his advances, the god transformed himself into a stallion. Afterward, [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") gave birth to the nymph Despoena and the talking horse [**Arion**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Arion/arion.html "Arion"). With Amymone, [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") fathered Nauplius; with [**Aethra**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Aethra/aethra.html "Aethra") ­– the divine [**hero**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hero/hero.html "Hero") [**Theseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Theseus/theseus.html "Theseus"). The list goes on and includes hundreds of consorts and at least as many children.

### **Poseidon and Amphitrite**

[**Amphitrite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Amphitrite/amphitrite.html "Amphitrite"), a Nereid, was [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon")’s faithful wife throughout. She didn’t want it at the beginning, though. In fact, she fled to the [**Atlas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html "Atlas") Mountains to escape the god of the sea. However, [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") sent Delphinus to win her. Honey-tongued Delphinus did the job in flying colors. As a favor, [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") set his image among the star: the constellation Dolphin.

[**Amphitrite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Amphitrite/amphitrite.html "Amphitrite") bore [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") three children: [**Triton**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Triton/triton.html "Triton"), [**Rhode**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Rhode/rhode.html "Rhode"), and Benthesikyme.
