![Athena](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/athena_7.jpg)

[**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"). A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact, even [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") feared her; and all Greek [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes") asked her for help and advice.

## **Athena’s Role**

### **Name**

[**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena")’s name is closely linked with the name of the city of [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"). The Ancient Greeks debated whether she got her name after the city or the other way around. Modern scholars usually agree that the former was the case.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

In art and literature, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") is usually depicted as a majestic lady, with a beautiful, but stern face, unsmiling full lips, grey eyes and a graceful build, emanating power and authority. She is always regally clad in either a chiton or a full armor. In the former case, she is sometimes represented with a spindle. In the latter case, she wears an elaborately crested Corinthian helmet and holds a long spear in one hand and an [**aegis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/Aegis/aegis.html "Aegis") in the other.

At the center of her [**aegis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/Aegis/aegis.html "Aegis") there’s oftentimes an image of a [**Gorgon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Gorgons/gorgons.html "Gorgons")’s head (Gorgoneion), symbolizing the gift she got from [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus"): the head of [**Medusa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html "Medusa"). Just like [**Medusa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html "Medusa")’s eyes, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena")’s shield can also turn her enemies to stone. As a symbol of her wisdom, there’s sometimes an owl flying in [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena")’s vicinity or sitting on her shoulder; from time to time there may also be a snake or an olive branch.

### **Epithets**

[**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") was one of the most important Olympian gods and she had many functions. Unsurprisingly, she was known under many different epithets. Some of the most famous were “Virgin,” “[**Pallas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Pallas/pallas.html "Pallas"),” “The Unwearying One,” “The One of the City,” “The One with gleaming eyes” and “The One who fights in front.”

## **Athena’s Early Life**

### **The Birth of Athena**

[**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") was born in most miraculous circumstances. On learning that [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis")’ next child may overthrow him, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") swallowed his first wife who was already pregnant with [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"). When the time came, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") started feeling tremendous headaches. As even he couldn’t bear them, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") struck him with his axe and – lo and behold! – [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") leapt out of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ head, fully armed and with a cry so mighty and fearsome that [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") and [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") were shaken to their bones with terror. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was delighted and full of pride.

### **Athena’s Childhood Friend Pallas**

As a child, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") had a friend she loved above all. Her name was [**Pallas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Pallas/pallas.html "Pallas") and she was all but her equal in the art of war. However, one day, as they were practicing some martial exercises, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") accidentally killed her friend. Grief-stricken and in an attempt to preserve her memory, she added her friend’s name to her own. That’s why many people know [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") as [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") [**Pallas**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Pallas/pallas.html "Pallas").

## **Athena, the Virgin Goddess**

Just like [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") and [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia"), [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") was never swayed by love or passion. Consequently, she never had any children. Some say that [**Erichthonius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Erichthonius/erichthonius.html "Erichthonius") was an exception, but, in fact, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") was only his foster-mother. True, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") did try to violate her, but she fought him off, so he spilled his semen over the Earth, after which [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") was impregnated. When [**Erichthonius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Erichthonius/erichthonius.html "Erichthonius") was born, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") took him under her wing, just like she would do afterward with another cult [**hero**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hero/hero.html "Hero"), [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles").

## **Athena, the Patron of Athens**

[**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") and [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") had a much-publicized quarrel over who deserves to be the patron of the most prosperous Ancient Greek city, [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"). [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") claimed that the city would benefit more from him than [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") and to prove this, he struck his trident into a rock, creating a seawater stream which welled up in the Temple of Erechtheion on the north side of the Acropolis. Smart as she was, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") did nothing spectacular: she merely planted an olive tree. However, the first king of [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens"), [**Cecrops**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cecrops/cecrops.html "Cecrops") – who was the judge of the contest – realized that the olive tree was much more beneficial, since it gave the Athenians fruit, oil and wood.

## **Athena, the Patroness of Handicrafts · The Myth of Arachne**

[**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") was a master artisan. As much as she was the women counterpart of [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") as a war goddess, she was also the female equivalent of [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") when it came to arts and crafts. Homer says that [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") fashioned ornate and luxuriously embroidered robes for [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") and herself. Some even say that she combined her two main interests to invent the war chariot and even the warship.

However, the most famous myth which connects [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") with handicrafts is the story of [**Arachne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Arachne/arachne.html "Arachne"), a mortal craftswoman who boasted that she was more skillful than [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") herself. [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") offered her a chance to repent, but after [**Arachne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Arachne/arachne.html "Arachne") refused, she challenged her to a weaving duel. The goddess fashioned a beautiful tapestry which illustrated the gruesome fate of the [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals") who had the hubris of challenging the gods. [**Arachne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Arachne/arachne.html "Arachne"), on the other hand, chose for a subject the stories of the [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals") unjustly victimized by the gods. She didn’t even have a chance to finish it: enraged and offended, [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") tore [**Arachne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Arachne/arachne.html "Arachne")’s fabric to pieces and turned her into a spider. As such, [**Arachne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Arachne/arachne.html "Arachne") is doomed to weave ever since.

## **Athena, the Helper of Heroes**

As a war goddess associated with wisdom – unlike [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") who was associated with mere violence – [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") was often the main helper of Ancient Greece’s greatest [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes"). Most famously, she guided [**Odysseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Odysseus/odysseus.html "Odysseus") during his ten-year-long journey back to [**Ithaca**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Ithaca/ithaca.html "Ithaca"). But, she also helped many others, such as [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles"), [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus"), [**Bellerophon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Bellerophon/bellerophon.html "Bellerophon"), [**Jason**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Jason/jason.html "Jason"), Diomedes, Argus, and [**Cadmus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cadmus/cadmus.html "Cadmus").
