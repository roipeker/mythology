### Greek God of the Sky and Thunder, King of the Gods

![Zeus](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/zeus_1.jpg)

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods") and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea"), he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"). [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis"), [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes"), [**Dionysus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Dionysus/dionysus.html "Dionysus"), [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles"), [**Helen of Troy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Helen/helen.html "Helen of Troy"), and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs. [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), [**Hebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hebe/hebe.html "Hebe"), and [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") are his legitimate children.

## **Zeus’ Role**

### **Name**

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ name is thought to have originated from the Ancient Greek word for “bright.” The word has a close connection with dies, which is the Latin word for “day” and has a very ancient history. Therefore, many mythologists believe that [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") is one of the oldest Greek gods.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

Usually, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") is portrayed with a scepter in one hand and a thunderbolt in the other – both symbols of his authority. Sometimes he wears a crown of oak leaves – the oak was deemed to be his sacred tree. Homer repeatedly describes him as “[**aegis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/Aegis/aegis.html "Aegis")-bearing”: the [**Aegis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Elements/Aegis/aegis.html "Aegis") was an enormous shield which [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") frequently carried with him, lending it to his daughter [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") from time to time. In addition, he owns a pet: a giant golden eagle called Aetos Dios.

### **Other Roles and Epithets**

Considered the ruler of heavens and the governor of weather, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was also associated with wisdom and awareness, with authority and destiny, with battles and power. In fact, Homer says that before the fight between [**Achilles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Achilles/achilles.html "Achilles") and [**Hector**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hector/hector.html "Hector"), [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") weighed their lots and blessed the outcome. Further down, the poet even claims that [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") owns two urns filled with ills and blessings – the gifts which he gives to every mortal in the amount he decides.

In relation to the many other roles [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") had, he acquired many different epithets. Some of them are: “warlike,” “oath-keeper,” “guest-patron,” “All-Greek,” and “Savior.”

## **Zeus’ Biography**

### **Family**

Paradoxically, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") is both the youngest and the oldest son of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea"). Namely, soon after the Creation of the world, the then-ruler of the Gods [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") – who had learned that one of his children would overthrow him – swallowed [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ three sisters and two brothers at birth: [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"), [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia"), [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), and [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"). [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") would have been eaten himself if [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") hadn’t slipped [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes in his place, hiding her youngest child in a cave on the Cretan Mount Ida.

### **Infancy**

There, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was raised by nymphs and met his first wife, [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis") – or Wisdom. On her advice, he masked himself as an Olympian cupbearer and tricked his father into drinking poisoned wine. The wine made [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") vomit so much that he ultimately disgorged [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ siblings – intact and ready for revenge. This, their second birth, made the youngest among them – [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") – actually their oldest brother.

### **Titanomachy: War for Supremacy**

Thus, they had no problem in acknowledging his authority. Led by him – and helped by the one-eyed [**Cyclopes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Cyclopes/cyclopes.html "Cyclopes") and the hundred-handed [**Hecatoncheires**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Hecatoncheires/hecatoncheires.html "Hecatoncheires") ([**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") freed all of them from [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus")’ imprisonment) – the siblings overthrew [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") during a decade-long war called the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy").

### **Zeus, the Ruler of the Gods**

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and his brothers drew lots to share the world between them. [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") got the sea, [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") [**the underworld**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/The_Underworld/the_underworld.html "The Underworld"), and [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") the sky. Finally, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was crowned to be the Ruler of all Gods and Men, referred to universally as Father.

## **Zeus’ Rule Challenged**

### **Gigantomachy and Typhoeus**

However, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") didn’t get off to a great start. His grandmother [**Gaia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") was angry at him for imprisoning the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans"), so she summoned her children, the [**Gigantes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Gigantes/gigantes.html "Gigantes"), to avenge her. Another war followed – the [**Gigantomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Gigantomachy/gigantomachy.html "Gigantomachy") – but the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") prevailed once again. This enraged [**Gaia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") even more, so she gave birth to [**Typhoeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Typhoeus/typhoeus.html "Typhoeus"), a giant fire-blowing serpentine monster, so mighty that even [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") needed some help (from [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") and [**Pan**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Pan/pan.html "Pan")) to defeat him after a cataclysmic battle.

### **Filial Revolt**

As a young ruler, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was apparently too prideful and petulant. So, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") and [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") – and, maybe, everyone else but [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") – decided to teach him a lesson. While he was sleeping, they stole his thunderbolt and bound him with hundred-knotted cords. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") was powerless, but the Nereid [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis") acted quickly and called Briareus, the Hecatoncheir, who used his hundred arms to untie him in a second. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") brutally punished the three leaders of the rebellion (especially [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")), and they swore to never challenge him again.

### **Prometheus**

[**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus"), however, did – first by stealing the divine fire and giving it to the [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals"), and then by keeping away from [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") the identity of a mortal woman whose future son was prophesized to become greater than his father. [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") chained [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") to a rock and tormented him for ages, but [**Prometheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Prometheus/prometheus.html "Prometheus") stubbornly refused to reveal to him the secret. In the end, for reasons we don’t know (because a large part of the play where this story is told is lost), the Titan did tell [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") that the woman in question is [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis"), so the god stopped pursuing her and gave her to [**Peleus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Peleus/peleus.html "Peleus"). The son born out of this marriage became a celebrated Greek [**hero**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hero/hero.html "Hero") - in fact, possibly the greatest among them all: [**Achilles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Achilles/achilles.html "Achilles").

## **Zeus’s Women**

### **Zeus’s Wives**

According to Hesiod, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") had the very same problem with his first wife, [**Metis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Metis/metis.html "Metis"). Warned that their child may be a threat to him, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") decided to swallow his pregnant wife. Nevertheless, the child, fully grown and armored, was eventually born – but from the forehead of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"). It was none other than [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), the goddess of wisdom herself.

Afterward, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") married [**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis"), who bore him the [**Horae**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Horae/horae.html "Horae") and the Fates. His third wife was [**Eurynome**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eurynome/eurynome.html "Eurynome"), who brought the [**Charites**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/The_Graces/the_graces.html "The Graces") to the world. His sister [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") followed; she gave birth to [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone"). With his fifth wife, [**Mnemosyne**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Mnemosyne_/mnemosyne_.html "Mnemosyne"), [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") begot the Muses. After becoming [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ sixth wife, [**Leto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Leto/leto.html "Leto") became the mother of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis").

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ seventh and final wife was his sister, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"). Knowing her sympathy for animals, he wooed her as a virgin by transforming himself into a distressed little cuckoo, which [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") took in her arms to warm it. At that moment, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") turned back into himself and slept with her. Ashamed, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") agreed to marry him.

### **Zeus' Lovers**

However, theirs would prove to be a bittersweet marriage, because [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), to say the least, was a promiscuous god. Bearing the shape of many different animals, he had numerous love affairs with many nymphs and [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals"), which made [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") jealous; some say that, when she scolded him for this, disguised as a serpent, he even slept with his mother, [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea"). Consequently, many gods and [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes") are [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ children. It’s impossible to list them all.

## **Zeus’ Equivalents**

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") is called [**Jupiter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Jupiter/jupiter.html "Jupiter") in [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") mythology. Additionally, his powers, symbolism and some of the stories woven around him, are similar to those of some other deities, such as the [**Norse**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Norse/norse.html "Norse") gods [**Thor**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Norse/Thor/thor.html "Thor") and [**Odin**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Norse/Odin/odin.html "Odin"), the Hinduist deity Indra, and the Slavic thunder god Perun.

## **Sources**

[**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") is pervasive in ancient literary sources. You can read about him practically anywhere. A good start would be Hesiod’s “[Theogony](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0130)” and Aeschylus “[Prometheus Bound](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0010).”
