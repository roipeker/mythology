[**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter")’s daughter, [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone").

## **Hades’ Role**

### **Name**

[**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") means “The Unseen One” – a suitable name since [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") is the ruler of the invisible world. However, the Ancient Greeks rarely used this name – just like Christians rarely used the word “Hell” during the Middle Ages. So, since minerals and precious metals are found underground, they often referred to [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") euphemistically as [**Plouton**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") – namely, “The Wealth-Giver.” Unsurprisingly, [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades")’ [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") equivalent is called [**Pluto**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Pluto/pluto.html "Pluto") as well.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

As the ruler of the dead, [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") was a grim and ghastly figure, inspiring awe and terror in everybody. Consequently, he was rarely depicted in art. When he was, he was most commonly portrayed with a beard, and a solemn, mournful look. He frequently wears a helmet, named the Helm of Darkness or the Cap of Invisibility. [**Cerberus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Cerberus/cerberus.html "Cerberus"), the three-headed dog which guarded the entrance to the Underworld, is usually beside him. Every so often he carries a scepter or holds the key to his kingdom. At a later stage, he became associated with his weapon of choice, the bident, a two-pronged fork modeled after [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon")’s trident. As [**Plouton**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), he was sometimes shown with a [**cornucopia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Amalthea's_Horn/amalthea's_horn.html "Amalthea's Horn"), the [**horn of plenty**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Amalthea's_Horn/amalthea's_horn.html "Amalthea's Horn").

### **Epithets**

Among the Ancient Greeks, [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") was known as “the Other [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus").” Homer even calls him “The Infernal [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"),” in addition to “the grisly God.” He was also called “the host of many” or “the Attractor of Man” – since all men eventually went to serve him.

## **Hades’ Family · Birth and the Titanomachy**

[**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") was the fourth child of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") (after [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia"), [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"), and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")), both the oldest and the youngest male sibling. In other words, he was the first of the three brothers ([**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"), [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")) to be born and swallowed by his father, but the last one to be regurgitated.

After being rescued by [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") from the belly of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus"), [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") joins him in the [**Titanomachy**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html "Titanomachy"). Eventually, the decade-long war ends with a victory for the [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians"). [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"), and [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") cast lots to decide who of the brothers will rule which domain. [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") gets [**the underworld**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/The_Underworld/the_underworld.html "The Underworld").

## **Hades’ Wife · The Abduction of Persephone**

Since [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") was a fearsome deity who rarely left his kingdom, there are very few [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths") about him in Ancient Greek sources.

By far the most important myth is [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades")’ abduction of [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone"), [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter")’s daughter. That was one of the few times [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") traveled above ground. The reason, naturally, was love: he fell for [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone"). However, [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") didn’t want to give in easily, so [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") devised an ingenious ploy. As [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") was gathering flowers with her maidens at the Nysian plain, he caused an indescribably beautiful flower to suddenly bloom before her. When [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") reached out to pluck it, the ground under her opened and [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") appeared before her, all dreadful and majestic in his four-horse golden chariot and took her with him to the Underworld.

[**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"), the goddess of fertility, was so distressed at the absence of her daughter, that she started fasting and wandering aimlessly. Finally, after nine days, [**Hecate**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hecate/hecate.html "Hecate") told her what happened. After the All-Seeing [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") confirmed the event, [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") left Olympus as an act of protest against the injustice done to her.

With her gone, the earth was as barren and infertile as a desert. One year passed, and the gods started worrying that the famine would wipe out humanity. So [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") sent all the gods, one by one, to beg [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") to come back, promising her all kinds of gifts and functions. She wanted none; the only thing she wanted was to see her daughter once again.

So, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") had no choice but to send [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") to [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") with the request that he return [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") to [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"). He complied, but only after making [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") eat one pomegranate seed before leaving. This ensured that she would remain bound to his kingdom eternally.

Now, both sides had no choice but to accept [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ compromise: [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") would spend two-thirds of the year with her mother, but one-third of it with [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"). And this is the part of the year which corresponds with the winter months: they say that [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") retreats from Olympus to her temple at Eleusis to grieve the absence of [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone").

It’s possible that [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") and [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") didn’t have any children. However, some say that [**Zagreus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Zagreus/zagreus.html "Zagreus") may have been their son. [**Macaria**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Macaria/macaria.html "Macaria") is also claimed to have been [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades")’ daughter – but no mother is mentioned.

## **Hades in the Bible**

As the realm of the dead, [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades") is mentioned ten times in the “New Testament” in its original Greek text. Older translations – such as the King James Bible – invariably translate it as “hell.”

Read the story of the abduction of [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") as the Ancient Greeks did: it’s fully recounted in the “[Homeric Hymn to Demeter](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D2%3Acard%3D1).”
