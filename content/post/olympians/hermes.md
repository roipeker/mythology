## The Messenger of the Gods

  
![Hermes](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/hermes_10.jpg)

[**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") is the winged herald and messenger of the Olympian gods. In addition, he is also a divine trickster, and the god of roads, flocks, commerce, and thieves. A precocious newborn, he invented the lyre and stole [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo")’s cattle on the very first day of his life. [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") was the only Olympian capable of crossing the border between the living and the dead.

## **Hermes’ Role**

### **Name**

Most scholars think that [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes")’ name derives from the Greek word _herma_, which means “a heap of stones” or “cairn.” Cairns were a common sight in the Ancient world, serving as trail- or boundary-markers. Some say that the first cairn was erected by the gods, when they cast all their stones in favor of [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes"), during his trial for slaying [**Argus Panoptes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Argus_Panoptes/argus_panoptes.html "Argus Panoptes").

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

Archaic artists portrayed [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") as a mature bearded man. However, later on, he was represented as an athletically built nude youth, immediately recognizable by four attributes: a broad-brimmed hat (_petasos_), winged sandals (_talaria_), a purse, and a herald’s wand (_kerykeion_, or caduceus in Latin). [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes")’ wand – a short-winged staff, entangled by two identical serpents – had magical powers, bringing sleep upon people or rousing them from it. It is very similar and frequently confused with the Rod of [**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius"), which is why [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes")’ wand is often incorrectly used as a symbol of medicine.

### **Epithets**

According to some [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths"), [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") wasn’t only a messenger of the gods, but also the inventor of speech. As such, he is often associated with oratory or interpretation. In Greece, an interpreter was called _hermeneus_, and today the science of interpretation is known as hermeneutics.

[**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") was the only Olympian capable of crossing the boundary between the living and the dead and carrying the souls of the dead in [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"). In time, he came to be known as “the conductor” or “the leader of souls.” People also called him “patron of travelers and thieves,” “shepherd of men,” “trickster,” and “Argus-slayer.”

## **Hermes’ Life and Deeds**

### **A Precocious Child**

[**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") was the son of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and Maia, the oldest of the seven Pleiades. He was born in a cave in Mount Cyllene in [**Arcadia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Arcadia/arcadia.html "Arcadia") at dawn. By noon he was able to invent the lyre and play a hymn celebrating his own birth on it. That very same evening, for reasons unknown, he stole the cattle of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"). Afterward, he came back and innocently tucked himself up in his cradle.

### **Hermes and Apollo**

To invent the lyre, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") killed a tortoise and scooped the flesh out of its shell. Then, honoring the Pleiades, he stretched seven strings of sheep-gut over the empty shell. Once he found out who had stolen his cattle, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") was so angry at [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") that bad things might have happened if [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") hadn’t appeased [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") with a lyre- accompanied song. In exchange for it, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") forgave his little brother everything and swore to be his closest friend forevermore. Some say that as a token of this promise, [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") gifted [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") with the latter one’s most emblematic object: the caduceus.

### **Hermes, a Darling of the Gods**

By all accounts, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") was a darling of the gods. [**Artemis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html "Artemis") supposedly taught him how to hunt and [**Pan**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Pan/pan.html "Pan") how to play the pipes. He was the one who guided [**Persephone**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Persephone/persephone.html "Persephone") back to her mother, [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter"). Above all, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") was very close with his father, acting in many of his affairs as [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ wingman. Most famously, he beheaded the hundred-eyed giant [**Argus Panoptes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Argus_Panoptes/argus_panoptes.html "Argus Panoptes"), previously sent by [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") to closely watch over [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ love interest [**Io**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Io/io.html "Io").

### **Hermes, the Messenger**

In his role as a messenger, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") is present in numerous other [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths"). He escorts [**Pandora**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pandora/pandora.html "Pandora") to [**Epimetheus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Epimetheus/epimetheus.html "Epimetheus"), leads [**Perseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html "Perseus") to the [**Graeae**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Graeae/graeae.html "Graeae"), and guides [**Priam**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Priam/priam.html "Priam") safely to [**Achilles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Achilles/achilles.html "Achilles")’ tent. In addition, he showed [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") the way to Mount Ida where [**Paris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Paris/paris.html "Paris") was supposed to judge which one of them was the fairest.

## **Hermes’ Women and Children**

Even though associated with fertility, it seems that [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") never married, and had relatively few famous consorts and children. [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") bore him Hermaphrodites and possibly [**Tyche**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tyche/tyche.html "Tyche"), [**Herse**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Herse/herse.html "Herse") – [**Cephalus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cephalus/cephalus.html "Cephalus"), and the nymph Dryope – [**Pan**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Pan/pan.html "Pan"). Later poets sometimes link [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") with Peitho or [**Hecate**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hecate/hecate.html "Hecate").

Once, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") and [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") fell in love simultaneously with the virgin [**Chione**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Chione/chione.html "Chione") and slept with her on the very same day. Later, [**Chione**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Chione/chione.html "Chione") gave birth to twins. Philammon took after [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and became a famous musician. Unsurprisingly, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes")’ son [**Autolycus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Autolycus/autolycus.html "Autolycus") became a trickster and a thief. Poets say that not few of his traits were inherited by his grandson: [**Odysseus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Odysseus/odysseus.html "Odysseus").

The [4th Homeric Hymn](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH%204) is dedicated solely to [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") and retells his childhood in length. In Lucian’s “[Dialogues of the Gods](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/lucian/works/chapter7.html),” there are few imagined interchanges between [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") and [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods") (3, 14, 15, 21, 24) which, now that you know [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") better, will certainly make you laugh. A brief preview: in the 24th Dialogue, [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") amusingly complains to his mother about the amount of work he has on his plate on a daily basis.
