[**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") is the god of blacksmiths and fire. Called “the celestial artificer,” he was also associated with other craftsmen (sculptors, carpenters, metalworkers) and, as evident in the name of his [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") counterpart Vulcan, with volcanoes. Even though an ugly god lamed by his own mother, he was the husband of none other than [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") herself.

## **Hephaestus’ Role**

### **Name**

It is not known what the name [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") means. However, since it’s similar to few pre-Greek toponyms (Phaistos), it is supposed that [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") is a very old deity.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

He is arguably the most extraordinary member of the Olympian Pantheon. Bearded and ugly, stocky and lame, he neither possesses the physical flawlessness of the [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods") nor does he stimulate the fitting respect. Sometimes he is depicted with an oval cap and almost always with a hammer and an anvil.

### **Epithets**

The epithets most commonly associated with [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") are far from flattering: “the lame one” and “the halting.” He is also sometimes referred to as “shrewd” and habitually as the “Aetnaean,” since his workshop was believed to be located under Mount Aetna.

## **Hephaestus’ Family and Difficult Childhood**

### **Son of Zeus and Hera**

Homer says that [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") was the son of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"). However, he is unclear whether he was born lame or whether he was lamed after his father threw him from Olympus for intervening on behalf of his mother during a quarrel between [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera").

### **Hated by His Mother**

Hesiod, however, claims that [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") is solely [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")’s child and that she gave him birth by parthenogenesis to get back at her husband who had done the same with [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"). In this version of the story, after bringing him to the world, [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") was so disgusted with [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus")’ looks and ashamed of his deformity that she was the one who threw him out. [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") was severely hurt from the fall, but he was rescued by [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis") and [**Eurynome**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eurynome/eurynome.html "Eurynome"), who sheltered him in a cave under the Ocean for the following nine years.

### **Hephaestus’ Revenge on Hera**

Later on, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") got his revenge. He made a golden throne, so beautiful that [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") accepted it right away. However, the minute she sat on it, she was all tied up by the numerous delicately fashioned cords invisible to anyone’s eyes but their creator’s. Many gods tried to persuade [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") to free [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), promising him a place on Olympus in return. However, he was unremorseful and released his mother only when [**Dionysus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Dionysus/dionysus.html "Dionysus") got him drunk.

## **Hephaestus as a Craftsman**

Just like [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")’s golden throne, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus")’ creations were masterworks.

### **Architectural Wonders**

No one but him was able to build the beautiful, indestructible bronze mansions where all the other [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") lived. Crafty and cunning, he added a distinctive element here and there, such as the secure doors of [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera")’s chamber which no other god but her could open.

### **Automata**

In the “Iliad,” Homer tells us something even more fascinating. Namely, that [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") had fashioned for himself handmaidens of gold, who were able to understand him, speak to him and assist him. And they weren’t the only creations of this kind. Among other automata, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") sculpted golden dogs to guard the palace of [**Alcinous**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Alcinous/alcinous.html "Alcinous") and [**Talos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Talos/talos.html "Talos"), a giant bronze man to protect [**Crete**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Crete/crete.html "Crete"). Some even say that, at the request of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus"), he also sculpted the first mortal woman, [**Pandora**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pandora/pandora.html "Pandora").

### **Arms and Armor**

Finally, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") was the creator of some of the most stunning pieces of military equipment ever seen. Most famously, as a favor to [**Thetis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Thetis/thetis.html "Thetis"), he created the shield of [**Achilles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Achilles/achilles.html "Achilles"), whose five bronze layers he masterfully engraved with scenes representing almost all aspects of life. But he was also the one who made the scepter of [**Agamemnon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Agamemnon/agamemnon.html "Agamemnon"), the breast-plate of Diomedes, and the sword of [**Peleus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Peleus/peleus.html "Peleus").

## **Hephaestus’ Women and Children**

For an ugly god, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") couldn’t have fared much better when it comes to women.

### **Hephaestus and Aphrodite**

Most commonly, his wife is said to have been none other than [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), the Goddess of Beauty herself. However, she wasn’t very faithful to him, sleeping with [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") behind his back. One day, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") caught the lovers and trapped them in a fine-woven chain-net, after which he called upon the [**other gods**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/other_gods.html "Other Gods") to laugh at their shame. [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") persuaded him to free the adulterers, but [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") wasn’t done. When [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") and [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite")’s daughter [**Harmonia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Harmonia/harmonia.html "Harmonia") married [**Cadmus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Cadmus/cadmus.html "Cadmus"), he gifted her a magical necklace which would bring misfortune to her and everyone who will afterward wear it.

### **Hephaestus and Aglaea**

Other authors say that [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") was married to [**Aglaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Aglaea/aglaea.html "Aglaea"), the youngest of the Graces. She gave him four children: Eucleia, Euthenia, Eupheme, and Philophrosyne.

### **Hephaestus and Athena**

One time, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") tried to force himself upon [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"). [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") managed to escape on time, so [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus")’ seed fell on the earth and impregnated [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea"), who afterward gave birth to [**Erichthonius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Erichthonius/erichthonius.html "Erichthonius"), an early ruler of [**Athens**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Athens/athens.html "Athens").
