> ### Greek Goddess of the Hearth

  
![Hestia](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/hestia_4.jpg)

[**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") is the Greek goddess of the hearth, one of the original Twelve [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians"). [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus")’ and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea")’s first-born child, she was pure and peaceful. However, since she always had to stay at home, tending the fireplace, [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") is not involved in many [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths"). Consequently, at a later stage, she would be replaced in the Pantheon with the much wilder [**Dionysus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Dionysus/dionysus.html "Dionysus").

## **Hestia’s Role**

### **Name**

[**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia")’s name means “hearth” or “fireplace,” and her status shows how important the hearth was in the social and religious life of Ancient Greeks. Making and preserving fire was both essential and difficult for more primitive societies, which made the household fire a sacred element at a very early stage of history. In later days, [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") became its embodiment.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

However, there are very few pictorial representations of [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia"). Usually, she is portrayed as a modest middle-aged veil-wearing woman. Sometimes, she stands by a large fire, carrying a staff or holding some flowers in her hands.

### **Epithets**

The Ancient Greeks didn’t use too many epithets to describe her. “Beloved,” “Eternal,” and “She of the public hearth” were probably the most common.

##   
**Hestia’s Family**

[**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") was the first-born child of the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans") [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea"). Since she was also the first one to be swallowed at birth by her father – and, consequently, the last one to be disgorged – [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") was oftentimes called the youngest of [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea")’s children.  
She had two sisters – [**Demeter**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Demeter/demeter.html "Demeter") and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera") – and three brothers: [**Hades**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hades/hades.html "Hades"), [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon"), and [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus").

## **Hestia’s Virginity, Peacefulness, and Domesticity**

### **The Vow of Chastity**

Since fire is a pure and a purifying element, [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") was worshipped as a virgin goddess. And they say that she became a virgin in order to keep the peace at Olympus. Namely, both [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") wanted to marry her; fearing that choosing either of them may result in turmoil, [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") swore to an eternal virginity by placing her hand on [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus")’ head. As a reward for maintaining the order and in place of marriage, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") granted her the central place in the house and the first and richest portion of humans’ divine offerings.

### **Hestia, Priapus, and the Donkey**

Only once was [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia")’s chastity subsequently put in danger. At a rustic feast, the drunken god of fertility [**Priapus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Priapus/priapus.html "Priapus") tried to rape the sleeping goddess. Fortunately, a donkey started braying and woke up both [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") and the guests, who chased [**Priapus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Priapus/priapus.html "Priapus") away in contempt. Ever since, donkeys were rested and garlanded on [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia")’s feast-day.

### **Hestia at Home**

Gentle and peace-loving, [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia") doesn’t appear in too many [**myths**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/myths.html "Myths") other than these two. Plato says that this is because she has to remain in the house of the gods, all alone, tending the eternal celestial fire even when all the other [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") ritually pass in processions through heavens. This is both her privilege and her predicament.

Consequently, [**Hestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hestia/hestia.html "Hestia")’s only manifestation among humans was the crackling of the fire. Aristotle says that it is the sound of the goddess laughing.
