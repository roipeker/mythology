![Ares](https://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/ares_image_6.jpg)

[**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena"), he represents merely its destructive capacity and is typically the personification of sheer violence and brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men. That is, with the exception of [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"), who bore him many children out of wedlock.

## **Ares’ Role**

### **Name**

Quite appropriately, [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares")’ name seems to have been an ancient word for battle or war.

### **Portrayal and Symbolism**

In art, [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") is usually represented wearing a helmet, a shield and either a sword or a spear. He drives a four-horse chariot and is accompanied by dogs or vultures. Sometimes, his sons [**Deimos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Deimos/deimos.html "Deimos") and [**Phobos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Phobos/phobos.html "Phobos") are also depicted beside him.

### **Epithets**

Unlike his nobler [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") counterpart [**Mars**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Planets/Mars/mars.html "Mars"), [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") was an unpopular god and never developed beyond the image of a divine battle-frenzy butcher. Consequently, only a few epithets have reached us. Unsurprisingly, few of them are flattering: “the bane of [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals"),” “the slayer of men,” “the city-stormer,” “the armor-clattering,” “the arm-bearing.”

## **Family**

[**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") was the oldest child of [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") and [**Hera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hera/hera.html "Hera"), and, according to those who think that [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") was born through parthenogenesis, their only son. Either way, he certainly had two sisters: [**Eileithyia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eileithyia/eileithyia.html "Eileithyia"), the goddess of childbirth, and [**Hebe**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hebe/hebe.html "Hebe"), the goddess of eternal youth.

## **Ares, the Unloved God**

Since he was the savage god of senseless war, [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") was almost universally detested. At one point, after [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") is wounded in battle by Diomedes, even [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") calls him “the most hateful of all the gods,” remarking that if he hadn’t been his son, he would have surely ended up in [**Tartarus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Tartarus/tartarus.html "Tartarus") with [**Cronus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Cronus/cronus.html "Cronus") and the [**Titans**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/titans.html "Titans").

The episode with Diomedes is only one of many in which [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") comes off second-best in his martial encounters. During the [**Trojan War**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Trojan_War/trojan_war.html "Trojan War"), [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena") needs no more than one stone to floor him, after which she spends some time mocking him and bragging of her superiority as a warrior. [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles") defeats [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") not once, but twice – first during the battle of Pylos, and then after killing his son Cycnus. Most humiliatingly, Otus and Ephialtes, the Aloadae, once manage to kidnap [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") and imprison him in a bronze jar for thirteen months. Homer says that if their stepmother Eriboea hadn’t told [**Hermes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html "Hermes") about it, this would have spelled the end of [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares").

## **Ares and Aphrodite**

[**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") had many women, but none of his affairs was as famous as the one he had with [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite"). At the time, the goddess of beauty was married to [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares")’ brother, [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus"), who was told by [**Helios**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Helios/helios.html "Helios") of his wife’s transgressions. [**Hephaestus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hephaestus/hephaestus.html "Hephaestus") fashioned a delicate, almost invisible, bronze net, which he put on the bed where [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") and [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") were supposed to lie. When they finally did in his absence, he stormed into the room with a host of gods. The [**Olympians**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/olympians.html "Olympians") laughed for days at the helplessly entrapped lovers.

However, it seems that in this case, [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") had the last laugh, since [**Aphrodite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aphrodite/aphrodite.html "Aphrodite") bore him at least three and as many as eight children. Hesiod lists only [**Deimos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Deimos/deimos.html "Deimos"), [**Phobos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Phobos/phobos.html "Phobos"), and [**Harmonia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Harmonia/harmonia.html "Harmonia"). Later authors include [**Adrestia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Adrestia/adrestia.html "Adrestia") and some or all of the four Erotes: [**Eros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eros/eros.html "Eros"), [**Anteros**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Anteros/anteros.html "Anteros"), Pothos, and Himeros.

## **Ares’ Companions and Other Children**

[**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") can rarely be seen alone on the battlefield. He is typically joined by a bloodthirsty crowd, a number of infernal associates symbolizing the terror of war. His sons [**Deimos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Deimos/deimos.html "Deimos") (Panic or Dread) and [**Phobos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Phobos/phobos.html "Phobos") (Fear) are almost always beside him. The same holds true for [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares")’ “comrade and sister” [**Eris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Eris/eris.html "Eris") (Strife) and [**Enyo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Enyo/enyo.html "Enyo") (the Sacker of Cities and “sister of war”). Sometimes, Kydoimos appears as well – the personification of the confusion and muddle of battle. Most frighteningly, so do the [**Keres**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Keres/keres.html "Keres"), the grim-eyed female Spirits of Death, dressed in cloaks crimson with human blood.

[**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") was associated with many bellicose [**heroes**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/heroes.html "Heroes") in Greek mythology, such as the aforementioned Cycnus or Diomedes of Thrace, whose man-eating mares [**Heracles**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Heracles/heracles.html "Heracles") was supposed to capture as his eight labor. Probably with his daughter [**Harmonia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Harmonia/harmonia.html "Harmonia"), [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares") fathered a whole race of warriors: the [**Amazons**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Amazons/amazons.html "Amazons"). Otrera gave him the most famous four: [**Hippolyta**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolyta/hippolyta.html "Hippolyta"), Antiope, Melanippe, and Penthesilea.

“[The Homeric Hymn to Ares](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH%208)” contains some of the very few flattering verses directed at [**Ares**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Aris/aris.html "Ares"). A large part of [the fifth book of the “Iliad”](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D5%3Acard%3D1) revolves around him and [**Athena**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Athena/athena.html "Athena").
