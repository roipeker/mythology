[**Amphitrite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Amphitrite/amphitrite.html "Amphitrite") was one of the sea nymphs [**Nereids**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Nereids/nereids.html "Nereids"), fifty sisters in total and daughters of [**Nereus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Nereus/nereus.html "Nereus") and [**Doris**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Doris/doris.html "Doris"). She was the wife of [**Poseidon**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Poseidon/poseidon.html "Poseidon") and had two children with him; a son named [**Triton**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Triton/triton.html "Triton"), a merman; and [**Rhode**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Rhode/rhode.html "Rhode"). [**Amphitrite**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Amphitrite/amphitrite.html "Amphitrite") also gave birth to other children, such as seals and dolphins. Initially, she was considered an important deity, as mentioned in the Homeric Hymn, when she was present at the birth of [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo"), alongside [**Dione**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Dione/dione.html "Dione"), [**Rhea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html "Rhea") and [**Themis**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Themis/themis.html "Themis"). Gradually, she became less important and in the end, the poets used her name as a mere representation of the sea. Her [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") counterpart was Salacia, the goddess of saltwater.
