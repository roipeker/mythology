[**Aether**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html "Aether") was one of the [**primordial**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Primordial/primordial.html "Primordial") deities in Greek mythology, the son of the [**primordial**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Primordial/primordial.html "Primordial") deities [**Erebus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Erebus/erebus.html "Erebus") (darkness) and [**Nyx**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Nyx/nyx.html "Nyx") (night), or according to Orphic Hymns, [**Chronos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Primordial/Chronos/chronos.html "Chronos") (time) and [**Ananke**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Primordial/Ananke/ananke.html "Ananke") (necessity). He was the brother of [**Hemera**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Hemera/hemera.html "Hemera") (day), and according to some sources, he fathered [**Gaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Gaea/gaea.html "Gaea") (earth), [**Thalassa**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Primordial/Thalassa/thalassa.html "Thalassa") (sea) and [**Uranus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Uranus/uranus.html "Uranus") (heavens). He was the personification of the upper air that only gods breathe, as opposed to the normal air breathed by [**mortals**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/mortals.html "Mortals"). The air encircling the mortal world was called [**Chaos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Chaos/chaos.html "Chaos") or Aer, while the Underworld where the dead dwelled was enveloped in [**Erebos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Erebus/erebus.html "Erebus"), the mist of darkness.
