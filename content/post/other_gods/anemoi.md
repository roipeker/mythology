The [**Anemoi**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Anemoi/anemoi.html "Anemoi") were the four wind gods in Greek mythology, each of them corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) from which they came. They were the children of [**Aeolus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aeolus/aeolus.html "Aeolus"), the Keeper of the Winds, and [**Eos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Eos/eos.html "Eos"), the Titan goddess of the dawn. The four gods were Boreas (North Wind), Notus (South Wind), Zephyrus (West Wind) and Eurus (East Wind).

Boreas was often described as a bearded old man with wings, who held a conch shell. He was closely associated with winter, as he was the bringer of cold and low temperatures.

Notus was linked to the hot wind that would blow after midsummer, causing the crops to burn and bringing the bad weather of late summer.

Eurus was considered to be an unlucky east wind, bringing rain and warm temperatures.

Zephyrus was thought to live in a cave in the region of Thrace, and was considered the gentlest wind of the four, closely linked to spring. It was also believed that he was responsible for the blooming of the lands.
