[**Aura**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aura/aura.html "Aura") was a deity that represented the gentle breeze of the early morning. It appeared both in Greek and [**Roman**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Roman/roman.html "Roman") mythology. She was the daughter of [**Lelantos**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Lelantos/lelantos.html "Lelantos") and Periboa. It is also said that Aurae were similar to ghosts, having the ability to disappear into the air.
