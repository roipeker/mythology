[**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius") was the ancient Greek god of medicine, son of the god [**Apollo**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Apollo/apollo.html "Apollo") and Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths. He was married to Epione, the goddess of soothing; together, they had a number of children; their daughters were Panacea (goddess of medicines), [**Hygeia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Hygeia/hygeia.html "Hygeia") (goddess of health), Iaso (goddess of recuperation), Aceso (goddess of the healing process), [**Aglaea**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Aglaea/aglaea.html "Aglaea") or Aegle (goddess of magnificence and splendor). They also had four sons; Machaon and Podalirius were legendary healers who fought in the [**Trojan War**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Trojan_War/trojan_war.html "Trojan War"); Telesphorus who accompanied his sister, [**Hygeia**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Minor_Gods/Hygeia/hygeia.html "Hygeia"), and symbolised recuperation; and Aratus.

[**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius") was given to the [**Centaur**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Centaur/centaur.html "Centaur") [**Chiron**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Chiron/chiron.html "Chiron"), who raised him and taught him medicine and the healing arts. At some point, [**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius") healed a snake, which in return taught him secret knowledge - snakes were considered divine beings that were wise and could heal. This is how the symbol of [**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius") and later healing was a rod wreathed with a snake. [**Asclepius**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Asclepius/asclepius.html "Asclepius") was so good at healing that he had managed to cheat death and bring people back from [**the underworld**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/The_Underworld/the_underworld.html "The Underworld"). As a result, [**Zeus**](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Zeus/zeus.html "Zeus") killed him to maintain the balance and placed him on the night sky under the constellation of the Ophiuchus (the snake holder).
